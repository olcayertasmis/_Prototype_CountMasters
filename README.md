# Prototype Count Masters

## Version
Unity 2020.3.27

## Info
The construction of this prototype game is based on the tutorial series video.

## Current Bugs
1- In the function of attacking the enemy, if their numbers are the same or close, it is calculated incorrectly. I guess when there is low fps, the error seems to happen more. I didn't fully review it.
2- People lined up on the tower have a misalignment.
